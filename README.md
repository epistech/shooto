This is a first CoronaSDK demo game

It's a little bit of a chintzy game, but it has end-states, score tracking, advancement, a high-score tracker and music. So that's something.

I'd like it to be a little bit more complex and interesting than it is so far. Perhaps with some semblance of a story, even!

## To-do
- Turn the music down. It's too loud right now?
- Make the badguy "@" move of its own accord

### 1.0.6
- Fixed scoring bugs
- fixed splash screens
- new animated sprite for main ship

### 1.0.5
- Added music
- Added highscore feature
