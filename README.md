Spaceship MiniGolf 
===================
(Formerly Shooto).

This is a first CoronaSDK game-in-progress. 


## To-do
- Turn the music down? It's pretty loud right now...
- Figure out how to multi-touch turn the ship so that it can aim in different directions
- Design a static course to start with
- Start designing a tutorial/set of instructions on how to play.
- Experiment with different gun-types that work in different ways.

## Future
- Stage-select screen
- Longer courses
- Refactor like wow.


### 1.0.7a1
- Make a "black hole" sprite to aim at.
- Boxes now vanish on hit

### 1.0.6
- Fixed scoring bugs
- fixed splash screens
- new animated sprite for main ship

### 1.0.5
- Added music
- Added highscore feature



Notes
------
It's a little bit of a chintzy game, but it has end-states, score tracking, advancement, a high-score tracker and music. So that's something.

I'd like it to be a little bit more complex and interesting than it is so far. Perhaps with some semblance of a story, even!
