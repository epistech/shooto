Spaceship MiniGolf 
===================
(Formerly Shooto).

This is a first CoronaSDK game-in-progress. 

Notes
------
It's a little bit of a chintzy game, but it has end-states, score tracking, advancement, a high-score tracker and music. So that's something.

I'd like it to be a little bit more complex and interesting than it is so far. Perhaps with some semblance of a story, even!

Lots of significant, but little, changes as described in updates section below. I also figured out how to create some designed levels, which might be fun for a future update.

## To-do
- Turn the music down? It's pretty loud right now...
- Design a static course to start with
- Start designing a tutorial/set of instructions on how to play.
- Cleanup directory and remove excess/old files (music and sprite sheets, in particular).
- Rebuild a new certificate for submission to app store.
- Create a title screen and brief instructions.


## Future
- Stage-select screen
- Longer courses
- Refactor like wow.


### 0.91b
- Almost ready for a 1.0 release! Submit this sucker Sunday, 7/26!?
* Changed badguy into a new fancy sprite, which had a couple of effects. It's a lot heavier, for one.
* Removed "SHOOTO" text, because it was confusing people.
* Changed scoring to increase values as a per-level multiplier.
* Added file-writing for high-score tracking.
* Added music back in, with a longer loop.
* Added iAds code for monetization.
* Updated the end-of-play/end-of-level text to create apparent advancement.

### 1.0.7a1
- Make a "black hole" sprite to aim at.
- Boxes now vanish on hit

### 1.0.6
- Fixed scoring bugs
- fixed splash screens
- new animated sprite for main ship

### 1.0.5
- Added music
- Added highscore feature


Will Not Fix
------------
- Figure out how to multi-touch turn the ship so that it can aim in different directions.
- Experiment with different gun-types that work in different ways.
